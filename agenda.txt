			uwexchanger is almost ok now, what it need is to make ads,
			I have already contacted with bulk email stuff,

			So, we'd better go to contact with registration office or 
			uw it to get their support first.
			
			For the programming stuff, we will still keep on making the
			instant message system that based on careercup. All we need
			to do is to make what we do better.
